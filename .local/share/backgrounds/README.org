** echidna_bliss.jpg

Go watch Re:Zero. It's a great show with a very hatable protagonist. In the second season we meet Echidna the Witch of Greed. Her whole thing is that she wants to know everything, understand /all/ the cause and effect, etc. I empathize with this on several levels, and hate the optimism and altruism of all the other "waifu-material" characters (that hurts to say, it really does), so I hereby decree that Echidna is Best Girl. There's definitely some weird psychology you could shoehorn into this and it would account for a lot of things, but I'd prefer not to think about all that. At least, not now. In my personal journal it will be revealed. I'm gonna have to publish that somewhere now. Anyway. Best Girl Echidna hosts a lonely tea party in her own pocket dimension, which bears a striking resemblance to a certain iconic photo. Hence this edit.

- It's the Apple image, then run through this very advanced filter:
  Increase darkness by 10. It's been some time since I did this, so definitely play with it yourself. Actually, find a better way to scramble the image in case Apple sues us.

** shockwave.jpg

I use this as my avatar on GitHub, YouTube, gmail, and a few other places (including the GNOME login screen, though that might not be transferrable). It's Shockwave from Transformers Prime. Which is a good show. Go watch it maybe. Anyway, this particular image has no significance except that it's the one nearest the top of the search results page that has a clear front-on view of his face. I have searched it up many times and always arrive at the same image.

It's like an anime profile pic but technically not and at most in an ironic capacity.
